Our community room offers 200 m² of flexible space—perfect for everything from birthday parties and family get-togethers to small conferences and meetings.

The room includes a fully equipped kitchen, bathroom, and a comfortable lounge area. It is barrier-free and easily accessible.

For families, there’s also a dedicated kids’ play corner with toys and games, so little ones can stay entertained while adults relax.
